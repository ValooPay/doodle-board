# Doodle board

## Capstone/Final project for the full stack web development bootcamp at Concordia

### Welcome to my final project, my little doodle board!!

First, let me give you a little tiny bit of context.
When I was a kid, just surfing the web aimlessly as you do in the early 2000s, I stumbled across a website that called itself a "oekaki board" (oekaki meaning scribbles/doodles/drawing, in Japanese). It was a website where people could draw and share their art with people and post them, kind of like a forum. In the early days of the Internet, I thought that was incredibly awesome!

Oekaki boards have always held a special place in my heart, I've met some wonderful people through it and learned so much from my experiences... So, I wanted to see if I could recreate something similar for my final project!

Hope you enjoy this silly little website!! ðŸŒž
