# Doodle board

## Capstone/Final project for the full stack web development bootcamp at Concordia

### Welcome to my final project, my little doodle board!!

First, let me give you a little tiny bit of context.
When I was a kid, just surfing the web aimlessly as you do in the early 2000s, I stumbled across a website that called itself a "oekaki board" (oekaki meaning scribbles/doodles/drawing, in Japanese). It was a website where people could draw and share their art with people and post them, kind of like a forum. In the early days of the Internet, I thought that was incredibly awesome!

Oekaki boards have always held a special place in my heart, I've met some wonderful people through it and learned so much from my experiences... So, I wanted to see if I could recreate something similar for my final project!

I wanted to keep things fairly simple. You can sign up, log in and start doodling right away! People can like your doodles & comment on them. You can manage the doodles you've created, whether shared or not (hidden!), and also check the ones you've liked!

The canvas to draw on is fairly simple for now, as I wanted to focus on the functionality of the website a little more, but I'd really love to update it in the future!! Not just the create drawing either, I'd like to expand more things on it for the fun of it. You can see some of the things I was considering in the To-Dos Tasks document if you're curious. But for now, this is it!! If I do add anything, I will update this file :D

Hope you enjoy this silly little website!! :)
