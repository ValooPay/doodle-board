# Front-end

- X Sign up, log in, log out
- X Add a button to toggle Shared
- X New drawing page w/ canvas & tools
- X Find a way to save canvas picture
- X Fix the manage doodles page to have only the doodles from a specific artist showing up
- X Sort drawings by newest posted
- X Fix "rendered more hooks than previous render" in ManageSingleDoodle
- X Add comments & like button to posts
- X Pagination for the posts page (Load more, might go back and change it at some point later to work with back-end)
- X On click, zoom in on drawing/make it full size (and back to smaller size when clicking on it again)
- Tokens or something for perpetual user login

# Done, but need sprucing up: 
- X Homepage
- X Post styled component (when viewing posts)
- X "Submit post" page set up with title, comments, drawing, etc.
- Create drawing page so the menu items/tools are on the sides instead of above



# Stretch goals

- More tools on the drawing page if have time
- Profile page
- Page of all users ? (Might do this one only if I have time to do profile pages)
- Search bar
- Timelapse of the drawing process
- Going back and editing a drawing made
- Animations??
- Social media aspect, Miiverse-ish
